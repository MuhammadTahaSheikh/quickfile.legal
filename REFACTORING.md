# Backend Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
The backend has been refactored from a monolithic `server.js` file into a professional, modular structure following Express.js best practices.

## New Structure

```
backend/
├── config/              # Configuration files
│   ├── constants.js     # Constants and configuration options
│   └── supabase.js      # Supabase client initialization
├── middleware/          # Middleware functions
│   ├── auth.js          # Authentication and authorization middleware
│   └── upload.js        # File upload configuration (multer)
├── routes/              # Route handlers
│   ├── health.js        # Health check endpoint
│   ├── upload.js        # File upload and file listing endpoints
│   └── users.js         # Admin user management endpoints
└── server.js            # Main application entry point
```

## What Was Changed

### 1. Configuration Files (`config/`)
- **constants.js**: Contains all application constants including CORS options and document base path
- **supabase.js**: Initializes and exports the Supabase admin client

### 2. Middleware (`middleware/`)
- **auth.js**: 
  - `authenticate()`: Verifies JWT tokens and attaches user to request
  - `requireAdmin()`: Ensures user has admin role
  - `getAuthenticatedUser()`: Helper to get user from token
  - `getUserDetails()`: Helper to extract user details from metadata
  
- **upload.js**: Multer configuration for file uploads with user-specific directories

### 3. Routes (`routes/`)
- **health.js**: Health check endpoint
- **upload.js**: 
  - `POST /api/upload`: Upload file
  - `GET /api/upload/files/:userName`: Get user's files
- **users.js**: Admin-only user management
  - `GET /api/users`: List all users
  - `GET /api/users/search`: Search users by email
  - `GET /api/users/stats`: Get user statistics
  - `PUT /api/users/:id/role`: Update user role

### 4. Main Server (`server.js`)
- Simplified to only handle app initialization and route registration
- Imports all routes and middleware

## API Endpoints (Unchanged)

All existing API endpoints remain exactly the same:

- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload file
- `GET /api/files/:userName` - Get user files (via `/api/upload/files/:userName`)
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users (admin only)
- `GET /api/users/search` - Search users (admin only)
- `GET /api/users/stats` - Get user stats (admin only)
- `PUT /api/users/:id/role` - Update user role (admin only)

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each file has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
3. **Testability**: Individual modules can be tested independently
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new routes, middleware, or features
5. **Code Reusability**: Middleware and helpers can be reused across routes
6. **Professional Structure**: Follows industry best practices for Express.js applications

## Migration Notes

- **No functionality was changed or removed**
- All routes maintain their exact paths and behavior
- All existing API clients will continue to work without modification
- The refactoring is completely backward compatible

## Running the Server

The server can be started as before:

```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev  # for development with nodemon
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

For future improvements, consider:
- Add unit tests for routes and middleware
- Add request validation middleware (e.g., express-validator)
- Add error handling middleware
- Add logging middleware
- Create a `.env.example` file for environment variable documentation
- Add API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Consider adding a `controllers/` directory to separate business logic from routes
